🏚️ Datapack Idea: “Abandoned Houses”

Hey everyone!
I’ve got an idea for a Minecraft datapack focused on vanilla immersion: a system that makes the world feel alive by automatically aging and decaying player-built structures when they’re left unused.

💡 Concept

Whenever a player builds a house or base, an invisible timer starts.
If there’s no player activity in the area for a certain time (e.g. 30 Minecraft days), the structure slowly begins to decay:

Stage 1: moss and vines start to grow (cobblestone → mossy cobblestone)

Stage 2: glass panes disappear, cobwebs appear inside

Stage 3: parts of the roof collapse, vegetation spreads around the structure

If a player returns, the process stops — or even slightly “repairs” the area over time.

⚙️ Technical goals

100% datapack (no client mods required)

Works on vanilla or Fabric/Paper servers

Automatically tracks player activity (via scoreboards or armor_stands)

Global tick function that checks for “abandoned” areas

Progressive degradation handled by separate functions per stage

Ideally configurable (duration, radius, affected block types, etc.)

🎯 Goal

I’m looking for someone who could code this properly as a datapack (not a mod), or at least help set up a clean and efficient system.
I already have a simple working prototype, but I’d love to make it more optimized, modular, and realistic.
